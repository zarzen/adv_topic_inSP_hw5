All instructions are included in `_hw5.ipynb` file, which is placed under same folder as this file.
You have to install `python3.7`, `ipython-notebook` to open the instructions file. 
The simplist way is installing `anaconda`. 
Please follow this link to get installation guidance: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install
