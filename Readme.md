# Homework 5, prepared by Zhen Zhang

All instructions are included in `_hw5.ipynb` file, which is placed under same folder as this file.
You have to install `python3.7`, `ipython-notebook` to open the instructions file. 
The simplist way is installing `anaconda`. 
Please follow this link to get installation guidance: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install 

If you have issues with environment setup or implementations,
you can contact me through [email](mailto:zhen@jh.edu) or open an issue at Github repo.
(I have created an account for this homework. If you need, email me.)
